# Task Buddy - Advanced Task Management System

## 🎯 Real-World Task Prioritization Features

Your Task Buddy now uses **proven productivity techniques** to help overwhelmed people manage their tasks effectively!

### 🧠 AI-Powered Prioritization Algorithm

The system uses a hybrid approach combining multiple real-world techniques:

#### 1. **Eisenhower Matrix** (Urgent vs Important)
- Evaluates tasks based on urgency (due dates) AND importance (1-5 scale)
- Overdue tasks get highest priority
- Tasks due today/tomorrow get immediate attention

#### 2. **Priority Levels**
- 🔴 **Urgent**: Critical tasks that need immediate attention
- 🟠 **High**: Important tasks to do soon  
- 🟡 **Medium**: Standard priority tasks
- 🟢 **Low**: Can be done later

#### 3. **Eat the Frog** Principle
- Identifies big tasks (4+ hours) that should be tackled early
- Highlights quick wins (15 min tasks) for momentum building

#### 4. **Time Management**
- Estimates total time needed for all tasks
- Considers task duration in prioritization
- Helps with realistic daily planning

#### 5. **Context-Aware Keywords**
- Detects urgent words: "urgent", "asap", "critical", "emergency"
- Identifies important markers: "important", "crucial", "essential"
- Recognizes time-sensitive terms: "today", "deadline", "meeting"

#### 6. **Category Weighting**
- Work, Health, Finance get higher priority
- Helps maintain work-life balance

#### 7. **Task Aging**
- Prevents old tasks from being forgotten
- Tasks older than 7 days get priority boost
